**Why I Am the Best Person for the Netflix Culture**

As I explore the opportunity to join Netflix’s Developer Enablement team, I am enthused by the alignment between my career achievements and Netflix’s mission of innovation and community building within the technology sector. My journey in software engineering, leadership in technology education, and passion for empowering communities uniquely position me to make a substantial impact on your team.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated an ability to lead complex projects and drive technical thought leadership across diverse teams. My roles, ranging from CTO at a venture-backed startup to Tech Lead at a billion-dollar space scale-up, have honed my skills in managing cross-functional projects and fostering collaborative environments. These experiences have prepared me to contribute meaningfully to Netflix's culture of continuous improvement and excellence.

At Monetisphere AI, I am currently developing a platform that integrates AI with the creative process, directly enhancing productivity and monetization for digital creators. This role showcases my expertise in managing documentation life cycles and ecosystems—core aspects of the Netflix role. My strategic vision is ensuring technology serves as a bridge to accessibility and efficiency, reflecting Netflix’s commitment to providing seamless and innovative service worldwide.

My dedication to technology education is evident in my roles as Senior Director at a national non-profit and as an Instructional Lead at General Assembly. Here, I developed and delivered educational programs that demystify technology, making it accessible and engaging. This aligns directly with the mission of the Developer Enablement team at Netflix, which focuses on technical onboarding and continuous education.

Through my podcast, "Deeper Than Code," I have taken a leading role in exploring technology's impact beyond the code, aligning with Netflix’s value of strategic innovation. My ability to communicate complex technical knowledge in an engaging and understandable manner mirrors the clear communication and impactful teaching that Netflix values.

Moreover, my work in mobilizing communities through technology, particularly at Seventh Ave, highlights my ability to foster collaboration and drive cultural engagement—qualities that resonate with Netflix’s inclusive and empowering work environment.

In summary, my blend of technical expertise, educational prowess, and visionary leadership makes me an ideal candidate for the Developer Enablement team at Netflix. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to and thriving within Netflix's vibrant and innovative culture, enhancing its impact across the engineering organizations.
